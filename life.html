				   	<ul>
						   <li align="justify">Don’t settle. There are close to 8 billion people in this world. Don’t let that 1 in 8 billion mistreat you.</li>
						   <li align="justify">Don’t trust the one person that has proven to be untrustworthy.</li>
						   <li align="justify">When someone shows their true color, don’t try to repaint the picture.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">The best prediction of future behavior is past behavior.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">No amount of love will heal betrayal. Love didn’t exist if they betrayed.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">There is no acceptable reason to cheat on your partner. If they cheat it has everything to do with them and not you.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Pay attention to words and actions. It’s rare when words and actions align.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Honesty, loyalty, respect and laughter make a relationship.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Listen carefully how they speak of others, especially their ex. You will be talked about in the same way. No one is perfect.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Liars rarely change.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">If you continually attract abusive people, it has nothing to do with the person you attract but everything to do with you.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Look at their friends and family. You will have your answer to who this person is.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Take your time before being intimate. It takes 3 months for the mask to slip.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">If they love everything you love on the first date. Run
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">If they call you their soulmate or twin flame quickly. Run
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">If they tell you they’ve never felt this way about anyone on the early stages of the relationship, but you. Run
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">They excessively text when the relationship is new. Run
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">They speak of many friends and you never meet any of them. Run
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">Love doesn’t hurt, love doesn’t cheat and love sure as shit doesn’t lie.
						</li>
						   <li align="justify">When you think you found the one, show patience, they will show you you’re wrong.
						</li>

					   <b>Am I ready for a new relationship?
					</b>

					<br> 
					<br>

				    <p align="justify">First, ask yourself, what part did you play in the break-up? It’s hard to admit we played a part even if you were cheated on and were with a very abusive person. After you figure out what “your” part was get to work on fixing that. If you are having trouble seeing your part journal about all your past relationships. Look for the similarities in the chaos with the person. Your part could be that you attract assholes, there are a lot, so that could be the case.</p>
					<p align="justify">And listen very carefully what each partner has said about you. Some of it may be true as painful as it is to accept. No one is perfect.</p>
					<p align="justify"> Then ask yourself why do you want to get into another relationship?	</p>
					<p align="justify"> What I’m slowly learning is if you don’t respect yourself or know your worth you will find the worst of the worst to show you why.</p>
					<p align="justify"> Go into a relationship because you two have something to add to what you already two already have.

						You build off one another, learning, supporting and growing together.
						
						One where you’re not cringing having to support their delusion and at the same time they aren’t doubt your abilities</p>
					<p align="justify">So many jump from one soul sucker to another with no break and find themselves in a worse situation than before. I know, I’ve done it.

						You also might cross a career abusers. They believe they are a great catch while jumping person to person. They leave a trail of destruction where ever they go blaming everyone but themselves. This type of person can teach you the most.
						
						</p>
					<p align="justify">Once you are more comfortable being alone, than in the presence of someone else, that’s a start. Strive to get ti that point in life.</p>
					<p align="justify">Get out and meet people. Don’t think of a “relationship” think of it as research, and with the research you are learning without devastating, painful lessons.

						While the painful lessons are great teachers once you experience it a couple times there is no reason to sign up for that class again.</p>
					<p align="justify">I’m a firm believer people are put in our path for a reason, good and bad. The whole goal is to be aware enough to recognize the “one” when they appear.

					</p>
					<p align="justify">Because many come wearing horns but are disguised as an angel.</p>
					<p align="justify">Once you aren’t looking it will happen.

						You just have to be aware of what is happening and have your side of the street free from clutter so you two find one another.
						
						Because neither of you two will be searching, it will happen organically.</p>
					<p align="justify">Trust the process.</p>
